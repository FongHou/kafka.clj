This [Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/) client library is a Clojure
wrapper for the [official java libraries](https://kafka.apache.org/). It strives
for a balance between being idiomatic but not too clever. Users used to the java
libraries will be right at home, although it is not a prerequisite.

It provides namespaces for handling consumers, producers, and doing some
administration. Also, we have the pleasure to announce that Kafka Streams is
fully supported.

## Usage

Read the fairly detailed
[API](https://dvlopt.github.io/doc/clojure/dvlopt/kafka/index.html).
